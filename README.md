Assignment Description: As part of the Congressional App Contest, our class developed a phone application using Android Studio (in Java) with a focus on budgeting. The purpose of our app to create a proper weather app. In certain countries like the US, Canada, Norway, and a few others, the government provides comprehensive and accurate weather data to the public free of charge. This data is of high quality and reliability. However, in most European countries, this is not the norm. In these countries, weather information typically only includes the current conditions. Forecasting requires extensive data analysis and numerical calculations. In countries where forecasting data is freely accessible, weather applications tend to be quite impressive. On the other hand, in countries where such data is not readily available, most weather apps are subpar in terms of accuracy and reliability. By using fire base I can arcuate get real time data of current weather patterns in the world at any time.
