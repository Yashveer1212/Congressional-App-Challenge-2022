In the US, Canada, Norway, and a couple of other countries government weather data is available completely for free. It's extremely good data and very accurate. In most of Europe, 
this just isn't the case. In these type of countries the weather will only tell you the current weather. For forecasting, you need people crunching numbers and analysing the data. 
In the countries where that forecasting data is available for free, weather apps are pretty good. In the countries where they're not, most weather apps are terrible.
